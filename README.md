Here is some projects made by me

In branch AI-api is a integration made for YouTubers, where you can upload your video project (.MP4) 
and it will convert in .MP3, then transcribe to a text.
So you will be able to select what prompt ChatGPT will execute: Generate 3 titles to your video or a description for YouTube.
You can  edit the prompt too.

Before run this api, generate a new AI_Key from openAI site and create a .env file in root directory with the followint setting:

```.env
AI_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

So to run the api, follow these 5 steps:
1 - click in the box "choose file", and select your .mp4 archive
2 - click in upload button and wait the "success" message
3 - select the prompt on selector above
4 - select the temperature at slide (when higher it is, most commic it will be)
5 - click execute and enjoy it!
